###### that is all


## What I learned

Git and github are pretty cool and they'll have your back when no one else will tbh. Also it's really awesome that you don't have to worry about a file getting corrupted on your computer and losing tons of work because if that does happen you have a backup stored on Github.
## Elevator Pitch Time

Have you ever wondered, why is it that some of the most famous people are the most corrupt? Why are the people who have the most power some of the most diabolical? Why do we award those that find themselves in these positions with more fame and attention when someone else could be in their position and be doing so much more good? That is why Clout was made! The first social media where your fame doesn't come from your follower count, but from how you're rated by your peers. Theoretically, the better the person you are, the higher ranking you will be! Clout allows for an overall rating (out of 5), a view of where you rank among those in your local community, country, and even the world, as well as the ability to leave reviews on people and the kind of person they are. This could be the next revolutionary step in social media, where the best kinds of people can finally get the attention they deserve! Clout, where do you stand?

## Post Simon Reflections
HTML is really cool and very verasatile, I'm really really excited to use it more especially as it applies to making our start up project.
I'm thinking about how awesome it will be for me to use the buttons and text boxes to make the login pages for the clout pages. Now my next big task will be thinking about how to design the actual profile pages where the rating is displayed.
