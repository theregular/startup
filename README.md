## What I learned

Git and github are pretty cool and they'll have your back when no one else will tbh. Also it's really awesome that you don't have to worry about a file getting corrupted on your computer and losing tons of work because if that does happen you have a backup stored on Github.
## Elevator Pitch Time

Have you ever wondered, why is it that some of the most famous people are the most corrupt? Why are the people who have the most power some of the most diabolical? Why do we award those that find themselves in these positions with more fame and attention when someone else could be in their position and be doing so much more good? That is why Clout was made! The first social media where your fame doesn't come from your follower count, but from how you're rated by your peers. Theoretically, the better the person you are, the higher ranking you will be! Clout allows for an overall rating (out of 5), a view of where you rank among those in your local community, country, and even the world, as well as the ability to leave reviews on people and the kind of person they are. This could be the next revolutionary step in social media, where the best kinds of people can finally get the attention they deserve! Clout, where do you stand?

## Post Simon HTML Reflections
HTML is really cool and very verasatile, I'm really really excited to use it more especially as it applies to making our start up project.
I'm thinking about how awesome it will be for me to use the buttons and text boxes to make the login pages for the clout pages. Now my next big task will be thinking about how to design the actual profile pages where the rating is displayed.

## Post Simon CSS Reflections
Looking back, me thinking that HTML was cool was a pretty chump move because CSS is even better. I feel like HTML is just a way to set up the skeleton of your work, and CSS is like what makes it actually shine. This will definitely come in handy as I design the clout app and make it look good. Now I know with confidence that I can make it look exactly how I want it to with the aid of Bootstrap and CSS.

## Post Simon Javascript Reflections
Wow, I'm honestly baffled with how far we've come and how advanced we've gotten. Pure HTML seems archaic compared to the possibilities that the combined forces of HTML, CSS, and Javascript can provide. As I mention everytime, I'm very, very excited to see what I can use the combination of these three languages to create and how I can involve them in the startup I'm working on. Javascript is definitely much more complex than HTML or CSS, but I'm working on learning its ins and outs so that I can utilize it in my startup and on future projects. The way it intertwines with HTML and CSS is fascinating and I hope to use it as I continue on in the CS field.

## Post Simon Services Reflections
Services are really important and frankly essential to what makes a website a website. I'm really excited to tie them with using a database because without a databse on the server, services and APIs feel a little bit pointless, but it's a good segway into being able to store and update information on a website.

## Post Simon Database Reflections
Now we're getting to the good stuff! Adding a database to the program has made it so much more realistic and now I finally feel like we have a full fledged application that's working! I'm really excited to add this to my startup and get it all working together with node and mongoDB! Awesome stuff!

## Post Simon Database Reflections
Now we're getting to the more complex stuff, and even though I don't quite understand all of it and how it all works together just yet, I'm grateful to have this code saved so that I can study it and continue trying to implement stuff like this. The more complex we get with these services and using cookies like this, the more applicable it is to the real world and applications that are made and need to have stuff like this. It's super interesting and I'm still excited to see what else is in store.

## Post Simon WebSocket Reflections
Websockets are very interesting, I didn't now a whole lot about what they were before this project and learning about it has been very cool. I definitely see the need for an almost constant connection to the server and the ability to be able to have multiple threads of connections going on at the same time is very useful. I'm excited to find a use for this in my startup application.

## Post Startup Javascript Reflections
It's really really cool to see how far the website has come. Now that there has been some Javascript functionality added, the website is much more interactive and user friendly. I feel like Javascript opens up an unlimited number of possibilites of where this could go and other functionality that could be added. I'm loving web dev so far and I'm very excited to keep learning more and keep creating.
