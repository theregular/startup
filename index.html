                <p> The first social media where your fame doesn't come from your follower count, but from how you're rated by your peers. 
                    Theoretically, the better the person you are, the higher ranking you will be! Clout allows for an overall 
                    rating (out of 5), a view of where you rank among those in your local community, country, and even the world, 
                    as well as the ability to leave reviews on people and the kind of person they are. CLOUT, where do you stand?
